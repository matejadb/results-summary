## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design using a desktop-first approach

### What i learned

This was my first time using Figma to translate a design into code. It took a bit of practice, but it helped me better understand layout structure and spacing.

### Continued development

I plan to revisit this project to optimize the code and explore adding new features, such as making the data dynamic and enhancing interactivity.
